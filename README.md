# Fitting of QYs

This repository contains the raw data and the fitting routines with the results for the determination of the reaction quantum yields of photoisomerization. See our [*J. Org. Chem.* paper](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.joc.1c02870) for details. At least [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/) and the following packages are required to run the Jupyter Notebook `Determination of QYs.ipynb`:

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)
* [LMFIT](https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/)
* [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
